A not so simple Android App for listing movies. 

Made with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

Following one of the best tutorials on the internet: [Kotlin Android Jetpack Compose](https://www.udemy.com/course/kotling-android-jetpack-compose-/)

Implements Navigation with NavController, NavHost, NavGraph. 

I played around with the code and added some features, like:
Loading an Actors profile in an Android WebView of Google Search.
